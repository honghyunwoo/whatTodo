  "passage": {
    "text": "In our rapidly changing world, many traditional cultures are at risk of being lost. Languages that were once spoken by thousands are now spoken by only a few elderly people. Customs that defined communities for centuries are being forgotten as younger generations adopt modern lifestyles.\n\nCultural heritage includes everything that a community values from its past: the buildings where ancestors lived and worked, the stories that were told around fires, the songs that mothers sang to children, and the recipes that were passed down through generations. When these things disappear, we lose not just practices but entire ways of understanding the world.\n\nOrganizations around the world are working to preserve endangered cultures. UNESCO, which is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, has created lists of intangible cultural heritage that needs protection. These include traditional dances, craft skills, and oral traditions from every corner of the globe.\n\nTechnology is playing an important role in preservation efforts. Researchers who work with endangered languages record native speakers before their knowledge is lost. Museums are digitizing artifacts so that people anywhere in the world can experience cultural treasures online.\n\nHowever, preservation is not just about saving old things. Living cultures must be allowed to change and grow. The young people who carry traditions forward often adapt them to fit modern life. A traditional recipe might be made with new ingredients. A folk song might be performed with electric instruments. This kind of adaptation is natural and healthy.\n\nThe key is balance. Communities need to decide which traditions are essential to their identity and which can evolve. What matters most is that people continue to feel connected to their roots while living in the modern world.",
