  "passage": {
    "text": "Everyone has dreams. Some people dream of traveling the world, while others imagine starting their own business or making a difference in their community. But how many people actually pursue their dreams? And why do so many give up before they even try?\n\nFear is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving our dreams. Many people are afraid of failure. They think, \"What if I don't succeed?\" But the truth is, failure is often a necessary step toward success. If every successful person had given up after their first failure, we would have far fewer inventions, businesses, and works of art in the world.\n\nAnother common obstacle is other people's opinions. Family and friends sometimes discourage us from pursuing unusual paths. They might say, \"That's not a stable career\" or \"You should be more realistic.\" If everyone listened to such advice, there would be no artists, entrepreneurs, or explorers.\n\nOf course, dreams need to be balanced with reality. If you wanted to become a professional athlete but had never played sports, you would need to start with smaller goals first. The key is to break big dreams into smaller, achievable steps.\n\nTime is another factor many people mention. \"If I had more time, I would pursue my passion,\" people often say. But successful dreamers make time by setting priorities. They wake up early, use weekends wisely, and sometimes make sacrifices.\n\nWhat would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? This question helps people identify their true passions. If money and time were not issues, what would you spend your life doing? The answer to this question can guide your choices, even if you can't pursue your dream full-time right now.\n\nRemember: it's never too late to start. Many successful people found their calling later in life. The most important thing is to take the first step.",
