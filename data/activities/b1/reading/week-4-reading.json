  "passage": {
    "text": "Technology has transformed nearly every aspect of our daily lives. From the moment we wake up to when we go to sleep, we are surrounded by digital devices that help us work, communicate, and entertain ourselves.\n\nThe benefits of technology are clear. Information that once took hours to find in libraries can now be accessed in seconds. Friends and family members on the other side of the world can be reached instantly through video calls. Work that previously required an office can now be done from anywhere with an internet connection.\n\nHowever, there is growing concern about our increasing dependence on technology. Research shows that many people check their phones over 100 times a day. Social media platforms, which were designed to connect us, are sometimes blamed for making people feel more isolated and anxious. The constant stream of notifications and information can be overwhelming.\n\nExperts suggest finding a balance between using technology and disconnecting from it. Some simple strategies include setting specific times to check emails and social media, turning off unnecessary notifications, and creating tech-free zones in the home, such as the bedroom or dining table.\n\nAnother concern is digital privacy. Every time we use an app or visit a website, data about our behavior is collected and analyzed. This information is used to show us personalized advertisements and content, but many people are unaware of how much of their personal information is being shared.\n\nDespite these challenges, technology continues to improve our lives in countless ways. The key is to use it mindfully and to remember that we are in control of our devices, not the other way around.",
