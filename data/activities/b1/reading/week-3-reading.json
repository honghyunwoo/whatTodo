  "passage": {
    "text": "Good communication is the foundation of every strong relationship, whether it's with family, friends, or colleagues. Yet many people struggle to express themselves clearly or to truly listen to others.\n\nOne of the most important communication skills is active listening. This means giving your full attention to the speaker, not just waiting for your turn to talk. When someone is speaking, try to understand their perspective before responding. You might be surprised how much this simple practice can improve your relationships.\n\nAnother key skill is expressing your feelings honestly but respectfully. Many misunderstandings happen because people avoid saying what they really mean. If something bothers you, it's usually better to address it directly rather than let resentment build up. However, how you say something matters as much as what you say.\n\nExperts suggest using \"I\" statements instead of \"you\" statements when discussing problems. For example, saying \"I feel upset when plans change at the last minute\" is more effective than \"You always cancel on me.\" The first approach expresses your feelings without blaming the other person.\n\nNon-verbal communication is equally important. Studies show that body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice carry more meaning than words alone. Maintaining eye contact, nodding, and keeping an open posture all signal that you're engaged in the conversation.\n\nFinally, remember that good communication takes practice. Nobody is perfect, and we all make mistakes. The key is to keep learning, stay patient with yourself and others, and remember that understanding each other is worth the effort.",
