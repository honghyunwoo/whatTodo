  "passage": {
    "text": "Our planet is facing serious environmental challenges. Climate change, pollution, and loss of biodiversity are affecting communities worldwide. However, there is hope. More and more people are taking action to protect the environment.\n\nOne of the biggest environmental issues is plastic pollution. Every year, millions of tons of plastic end up in our oceans, harming marine life and entering our food chain. Many countries have started banning single-use plastics like bags and straws. These bans are becoming increasingly common as people recognize the damage caused by disposable items.\n\nClimate change is perhaps the most urgent challenge we face. Global temperatures are rising faster than ever before, causing extreme weather events like floods, droughts, and hurricanes. Scientists agree that reducing carbon emissions is essential. This means using more renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and changing the way we travel and consume goods.\n\nThe good news is that solutions exist, and many are becoming more affordable. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many parts of the world. Electric vehicles are becoming as common as traditional cars in some cities. Sustainable farming methods are being adopted to protect soil and water.\n\nWhat can individuals do? Small changes in daily habits can make a significant difference. Using public transport, reducing meat consumption, saving water and electricity, and choosing products with less packaging all help. The more people who make these choices, the greater the impact.\n\nEducation is also crucial. The younger generation is often more aware of environmental issues than their parents were. Young activists around the world are demanding action from governments and businesses. Their passion and determination give us hope for the future.\n\nProtecting the environment is not just the responsibility of governments or large companies. It requires action from all of us. Every small step counts.",
