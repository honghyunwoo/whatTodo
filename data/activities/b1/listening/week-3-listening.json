Is that true?\nMark: What? No, I didn't say that exactly. I think there's been a misunderstanding.\nJane: Then what did you say? Because Sarah told me that you said I was gossiping about her.\nMark: Let me explain. Sarah asked me if you had mentioned anything about her job situation. I just said that you told me she was thinking about quitting. I didn't mean it in a bad way.\nJane: Oh, I see. But you know I told you that in confidence. I trusted you not to share it with anyone.\nMark: I know, and I'm really sorry. I didn't think it would cause any problems. Sarah seemed worried about her future, and I thought she already knew that you knew.\nJane: I understand, but in the future, could you please check with me first before sharing anything I tell you?\nMark: You're absolutely right. I apologize for not being more careful. I should have asked you first.\nJane: I appreciate that. I know you didn't mean any harm.\nMark: I really didn't. I value our friendship, and I don't want something like this to come between us.\nJane: Neither do I. Let's just make sure we communicate better from now on.\nMark: Agreed. And I'll talk to Sarah and explain everything. I don't want her to misunderstand the situation either.\nJane: That would be great. Thanks for being understanding, Mark.\nMark: Of course. And thanks for coming to me directly instead of assuming the worst. I appreciate that.",
