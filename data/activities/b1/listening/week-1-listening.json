Tell me everything! What have you been up to?\nMike: Well, the biggest news is that I've finally graduated from university. I finished my degree last month.\nSarah: Congratulations! That's amazing! Have you found a job yet?\nMike: Yes, I've just started working at a marketing company downtown. I've only been there for two weeks, but I'm really enjoying it so far.\nSarah: That's wonderful! I remember you always wanted to work in marketing.\nMike: Exactly! It's been my dream for years. What about you? Have you done anything exciting recently?\nSarah: Actually, yes! I've just come back from traveling. I've been to Southeast Asia for three months.\nMike: Wow! Which countries have you visited?\nSarah: I've been to Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It was the best experience of my life. I've learned so much about different cultures.\nMike: Have you ever traveled alone before?\nSarah: No, this was my first time traveling solo. I was nervous at first, but it has really changed me. I've become much more confident and independent.\nMike: That sounds incredible. Have you already decided what to do next?\nSarah: I've actually just accepted a job offer. I'm going to work as a travel blogger!\nMike: No way! That's perfect for you. You've always been a great writer.\nSarah: Thanks! I've never thought I could turn my passion into a career, but here I am.\nMike: We should celebrate! Have you had lunch yet?\nSarah: No, not yet. Let's grab something to eat and catch up more!",
