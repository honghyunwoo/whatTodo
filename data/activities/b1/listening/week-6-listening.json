    "text": "Kate: Hi James, you look stressed. What's wrong?\nJames: I have three exams next week and I don't know how I'm going to prepare for all of them.\nKate: That sounds tough. Have you made a study plan?\nJames: Not really. I usually just study everything the night before.\nKate: That's probably not the best strategy. If you try to learn everything in one night, you won't remember much.\nJames: I know, but I always leave things to the last minute.\nKate: Maybe you should try a different approach. If you study a little bit every day, the information will stick better.\nJames: How do you organize your studying?\nKate: I make a schedule. I divide each subject into smaller topics and assign specific days to each one.\nJames: That sounds very organized. What if you don't understand something?\nKate: If I get stuck on something, I usually watch YouTube tutorials or ask a classmate. There are great resources online.\nJames: Do you think online resources are as good as textbooks?\nKate: They can be. If you find the right channels, they explain things really well. But you should also read your notes and textbooks.\nJames: What about memorizing facts? I find that really difficult.\nKate: If you use flashcards or apps like Anki, it becomes easier. They use a system where you review things just before you forget them.\nJames: I've heard of that. Spaced repetition, right?\nKate: Exactly! And here's another tip: if you study in a quiet place without your phone, you'll concentrate much better.\nJames: That's my biggest problem. I get distracted by my phone constantly.\nKate: Turn it off or leave it in another room. If you check your phone every few minutes, you'll lose focus.\nJames: You're right. I'll try your advice. Thanks, Kate!\nKate: No problem. Good luck with your exams!",
