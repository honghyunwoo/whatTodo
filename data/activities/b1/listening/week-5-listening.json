    "text": "Emma: Have you heard about the new recycling program in our city?\nTom: Yes, I saw something about it in the news. What's changing?\nEmma: Well, they're making it easier to recycle more types of plastic. Before, we could only recycle numbers one and two, but now we can recycle up to number five.\nTom: That's great news. I always felt bad throwing away so much plastic.\nEmma: Me too. But recycling is just one part of the solution. I think we need to reduce how much we use in the first place.\nTom: You're right. I've been trying to use fewer disposable products. I bought a reusable water bottle and coffee cup.\nEmma: That's a good start. I've also switched to cloth bags instead of plastic ones. It takes some getting used to, but it's worth it.\nTom: The more people do these small things, the bigger the impact will be.\nEmma: Exactly. I read that if everyone reduced their plastic use by just twenty percent, it would make a huge difference.\nTom: What else can we do? I want to reduce my carbon footprint more.\nEmma: Well, eating less meat is one of the most effective things you can do. The meat industry produces more greenhouse gases than all transportation combined.\nTom: Really? I had no idea. That's much more than I expected.\nEmma: Yes, it's surprising. You don't have to become vegetarian, but even cutting down to meat three or four times a week helps.\nTom: I could probably do that. What about transportation?\nEmma: Using public transport is far better than driving alone. Or better yet, cycling or walking when possible.\nTom: The weather is getting nicer, so maybe I'll start cycling to work. It would be good for my health too.\nEmma: That's a great idea. Every little change helps.",
