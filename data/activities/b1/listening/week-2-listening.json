    "text": "Manager: Alright everyone, let's discuss the marketing project. We need to have everything ready by the end of the month. Lisa, what are you going to work on?\nLisa: I'm going to focus on the social media campaign. I've already started brainstorming ideas, and I'm meeting with the design team tomorrow to discuss visuals.\nManager: Great. How long do you think it will take?\nLisa: I estimate it will take about two weeks to complete the initial plan. After that, I'll need another week to finalize everything.\nManager: Perfect. Tom, what about you?\nTom: I'm going to handle the market research. I'll be sending out surveys next week, and I'm expecting results within ten days.\nManager: Will you have the analysis ready by the fifteenth?\nTom: I think so, but there's a possibility we might need a few extra days if we get a lot of responses.\nManager: That's fine. Just keep me updated. Sarah, you're working on the budget, right?\nSarah: Yes, I'm going to prepare the budget proposal. I'll probably finish the first draft by Friday. Then I'm going to review it with the finance team next Monday.\nManager: Excellent. Now, are there any potential problems we should anticipate?\nLisa: Well, the design team is quite busy this month. There's a chance they won't be able to deliver on time.\nManager: I'll talk to them about priorities. Anything else?\nTom: The survey platform might be down for maintenance next Wednesday. If that happens, I'll postpone the launch until Thursday.\nManager: Good thinking. Let's schedule a follow-up meeting for next Friday at 2 PM. Does that work for everyone?\nAll: Yes, that works.\nManager: Great. I'll send calendar invites this afternoon. Thanks, everyone!",
