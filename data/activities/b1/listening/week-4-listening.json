    "text": "Alex: Hey Lisa, did you see that article about digital detox? Apparently, the average person spends over four hours a day on their phone.\nLisa: Four hours? That sounds about right, actually. I've been trying to cut down on my screen time recently.\nAlex: Really? How's that going?\nLisa: Well, I deleted social media apps from my phone last week. It was hard at first, but I've noticed I'm sleeping better.\nAlex: That's interesting. I've heard that the blue light from screens can affect your sleep.\nLisa: Yes, exactly. And I was checking notifications constantly, which was really stressful. Now I only check social media on my laptop once a day.\nAlex: I should probably do something similar. I waste so much time just scrolling through my feed without even thinking about it.\nLisa: It's designed that way, you know. The algorithms are made to keep you engaged as long as possible.\nAlex: That's a bit scary when you think about it. What else have you changed?\nLisa: I started leaving my phone in another room when I'm working or studying. My productivity has improved so much.\nAlex: I've tried that, but I always worry about missing something important.\nLisa: That's what I thought too, but honestly, nothing is that urgent. And if it is, people can call you.\nAlex: True. I think I'm going to try a digital detox this weekend. No phone except for calls and emergencies.\nLisa: That sounds like a great start. Let me know how it goes!\nAlex: I will. Thanks for the inspiration!",
