    "text": "These days, many people prefer shopping online instead of going to physical stores. Online shopping is very convenient because you can buy things from home at any time. You don't need to drive or find parking. Also, you can easily compare prices from different websites.\n\nHowever, shopping in stores has its advantages too. You can try on clothes before buying them, so you know if they fit. You can also see and touch products. If something is wrong, you can return it immediately.\n\nI personally use both methods. For electronics and books, I usually shop online because I can read reviews first. But for clothes and shoes, I prefer going to the store. I don't want to buy something that doesn't fit!\n\nWhat about you? Do you like online shopping or do you prefer traditional stores?",
