    "text": "My name is Minho and I work as a marketing assistant at a company in Seoul. I want to tell you about my typical weekday.\n\nI wake up at 6:30 every morning. First, I take a quick shower and get dressed. Then I have breakfast - usually just coffee and toast because I don't have much time. I leave home at 7:30 and commute to work by subway. The journey takes about 45 minutes.\n\nI arrive at the office around 8:15. I usually start by checking my emails and planning my tasks for the day. We have team meetings every Monday and Wednesday morning. I often work on presentations and reports. My colleagues are friendly, and we sometimes have lunch together at a restaurant near the office.\n\nI finish work at 6 p.m., but sometimes I work overtime when there's a deadline. After work, I usually go to the gym twice a week. On other days, I just go home and relax. I try to go to bed before midnight because I need enough sleep.\n\nWeekends are different. I rarely wake up before 9 a.m. I spend time with friends, watch movies, or just rest at home.",
