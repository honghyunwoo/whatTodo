    "text": "Korea has four distinct seasons, and each one has its own special beauty.\n\nSpring (March to May) is a wonderful time to visit Korea. The weather is mild and warm, with temperatures between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius. Cherry blossoms bloom in April, and many people go to parks to enjoy the flowers. Spring is not as hot as summer, so it's comfortable to walk outside.\n\nSummer (June to August) is hot and humid. July and August are the hottest months, with temperatures often reaching 30 degrees or higher. There's also a rainy season called 'jangma' in late June and July. Summer is the busiest time at beaches.\n\nAutumn (September to November) is many people's favorite season. The weather is cooler and drier than summer. The leaves change colors - red, orange, and yellow - creating beautiful landscapes. October is the best month for hiking because the weather is perfect.\n\nWinter (December to February) is cold and dry. January is the coldest month, with temperatures below zero. It snows several times during winter, especially in the mountains. Many Koreans go skiing or visit hot springs during this season.\n\nEach season offers different activities and experiences. Which season would you like to visit Korea?",
