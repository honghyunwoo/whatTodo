We also went to a waterfall called Cheonjiyeon. The water was so clear and beautiful!\n\nOn our last day, we rented bicycles and rode along the coast. The weather was perfect - sunny but not too hot. We ate fresh seafood for dinner at a local restaurant.\n\nI had such a wonderful time in Jeju. I want to go back again next year. It is definitely my favorite vacation destination.",
