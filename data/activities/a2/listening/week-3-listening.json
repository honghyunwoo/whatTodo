Can I get you something to drink first? [PAUSE] Customer: I'll have a glass of red wine, and water for my friend. [PAUSE] Waiter: Of course. Are you ready to order food, or do you need a few minutes? [PAUSE] Customer: We're ready. What do you recommend? [PAUSE] Waiter: Our grilled salmon is very popular today. [PAUSE] Customer: That sounds good. I'll have the salmon. And she'll have the pasta. [PAUSE] Waiter: How would you like your salmon? [PAUSE] Customer: Medium, please. And is the pasta spicy? [PAUSE] Waiter: No, it's quite mild. Would you like any appetizers? [PAUSE] Customer: Yes, we'll share the soup of the day. [PAUSE] Waiter: Excellent choice. Your food will be ready in about 20 minutes.",
