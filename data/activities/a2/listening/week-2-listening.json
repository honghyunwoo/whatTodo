[PAUSE] Assistant: It's 80 dollars, but today we have a 25% discount. So it's 60 dollars. [PAUSE] Customer: That's a good price! Can I try it on? [PAUSE] Assistant: Sure. The fitting room is on your left. [PAUSE] Customer: Perfect, it fits well. I'll take it. [PAUSE] Assistant: Great choice! Will you pay by cash or card? [PAUSE] Customer: Card, please.
