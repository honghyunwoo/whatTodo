Do you know where City Hall is?\nTourist: Yes, I passed it on my way here.\nLocal: Great! So, from here, go straight for about two blocks. You'll see a big intersection with traffic lights.\nTourist: Okay, go straight for two blocks to the intersection.\nLocal: Right. At the intersection, turn left. Walk past the post office - it's on your right.\nTourist: Turn left, then pass the post office.\nLocal: Yes. After the post office, continue for one more block. The museum will be on your left. It's a large building with a modern design. You can't miss it.\nTourist: So it's on the left, after the post office?\nLocal: Exactly. It's about a 10-minute walk from here.\nTourist: Is it open today? Do you know?\nLocal: I think it's open every day except Monday. And today is Wednesday, so you should be fine.\nTourist: Thank you so much for your help!\nLocal: You're welcome. Enjoy your visit!",
