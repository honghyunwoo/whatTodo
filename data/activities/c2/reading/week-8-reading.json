    "author": "Adapted from contemporary philosophical sources",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Philosophy, we are sometimes told, has reached its end. Not its completion—as Hegel imagined, with the Absolute finally grasping itself—but its exhaustion. The great questions, on this view, have either been answered by science or exposed as pseudo-questions dissolving under logical analysis. What remains is at best the therapy of conceptual confusion, at worst an obsolete pretension. Yet the reports of philosophy's death have themselves become philosophically interesting. The claim that philosophy is finished is itself a philosophical claim, one that presupposes criteria for what counts as a genuine question and a satisfactory answer. The question of philosophy's status cannot be settled from outside philosophy.",
      "The more subtle challenge comes not from scientism but from historicism—the recognition that all thought is conditioned by its historical situation. If philosophy cannot transcend its context, if there is no view from nowhere, then what becomes of the aspiration to truth? Gadamer's hermeneutics embraces this finitude: understanding is always from a particular horizon, shaped by tradition, mediated by language. But this need not collapse into relativism. Horizons can fuse; traditions can be transformed; the conversation of humanity proceeds even without final foundations. What we lose is not truth but the fantasy of absolute knowledge that was always a philosopher's dream and never a human possibility.",
      "Perhaps philosophy's future lies not in solving its canonical problems but in transforming them. The question 'What is knowledge?' may admit no final answer, but pursuing it transforms how we know. The question 'What is justice?' may be interminable, but engaging it shapes more just societies. Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but a practice of inquiry—a way of subjecting our deepest assumptions to critical examination. In this sense, philosophy is less something we know than something we do: a disciplined refusal of the unexamined life.",
      "What then of wisdom? The ancients conceived philosophy as love of wisdom—not possession but pursuit. Wisdom differs from knowledge in being irreducibly practical: knowing how to live, not just what is the case. It includes judgment, which cannot be reduced to rules; prudence, which discerns the right action in particular circumstances; and a kind of self-knowledge that renders one less liable to the illusions that distort human life. If philosophy has a future, it may be in recovering this older conception: not a technical discipline competing with science but a way of life oriented toward the good."
