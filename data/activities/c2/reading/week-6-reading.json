    "title": "Moral Realism and Its Discontents",
    "author": "Adapted from metaethical sources",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Moral realism holds that there are objective moral truths independent of what anyone believes. On this view, the wrongness of torture is not merely a social convention or an expression of attitude but a fact about the world. This position has intuitive appeal: when we argue about ethics, we seem to be arguing about something, not merely expressing preferences. Yet moral realism faces formidable challenges that have fueled centuries of philosophical debate.",
      "The epistemological challenge asks how we could come to know moral truths if they exist. Mathematical truths, whatever their metaphysical status, can be proven through valid inference. Empirical truths can be tested against observation. But moral truths seem neither provable nor observable. We cannot point to wrongness the way we point to redness; we cannot deduce it from logical axioms alone. The moral realist must explain what faculty enables moral knowledge. Appeals to intuition seem question-begging: whose intuitions, and why should they track truth?",
      "The metaphysical challenge—J.L. Mackie's 'queerness' objection—questions what moral facts would be. They cannot be physical facts, for 'is' does not entail 'ought.' They cannot be mere social facts, for that would make morality relative. Moral facts would have to be entities of a strange sort: intrinsically motivating, inherently normative, providing reasons for action independent of our desires. Can we make sense of such entities? And if we could, how would they connect to the natural world we otherwise understand causally?",
      "Anti-realists propose various alternatives. Expressivists argue that moral statements express attitudes rather than describe facts. Error theorists accept that moral statements purport to describe facts but hold that they systematically fail: all positive moral claims are false. Constructivists locate moral truth in what we would agree to under idealized conditions. Each alternative faces its own difficulties, but their persistence suggests that moral realism's troubles are not easily dismissed. Perhaps the question of moral foundations admits no comfortable answer—a possibility that moral philosophy must learn to inhabit."
