    "title": "Attention as Moral Practice",
    "author": "Adapted from philosophy and ethics sources",
    "paragraphs": [
      "The attention economy, we are told, is extractive: social media platforms, streaming services, and apps compete to capture and monetize our limited attentional resources. This framing, while illuminating, may inadvertently reduce attention to a commodity—something we possess in finite quantities and can either spend wisely or squander. But attention is not merely a resource to be managed; it is, as philosopher Simone Weil argued, the substance of moral life itself. 'Attention, taken to its highest degree,' Weil wrote, 'is the same thing as prayer.' To attend to another person, truly and fully, is already an ethical act.",
      "This conception invites us to reconsider not just our digital habits but our basic orientation toward the world. The contemporary malaise of distraction is not merely inefficiency; it is a form of moral erosion. When we half-attend—scrolling while our child speaks, composing emails during meetings, toggling between tasks—we enact a kind of violence against the present. The objects of our attention are demoted; they become interruptions rather than encounters. What is lost is not just productivity but the capacity for genuine meeting, what Martin Buber called the I-Thou relation.",
      "Yet we must resist romanticizing attention as something spontaneous and unmediated. Attention is always structured by what phenomenologists call 'horizons of relevance'—the background frameworks that determine what shows up as significant. These horizons are themselves shaped by culture, education, and increasingly, algorithmic curation. The platforms we decry for fragmenting our attention are simultaneously shaping what we find attention-worthy. The task, then, is not merely to attend more fully but to interrogate the conditions of attention itself.",
      "What would an ethics of attention look like in practice? It might begin with the simple but radical act of unitasking—giving one thing our undivided presence. It might involve cultivating what the Buddhists call 'bare attention': a receptivity that does not immediately categorize and evaluate. And it might require structural critique: asking who benefits when our attention is fragmented, and what forms of solidarity become possible when we attend together. Attention, in this light, is not a private resource but a collective practice."
