    "title": "The Politics of Language",
    "author": "Adapted from sociolinguistics and critical theory sources",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Language is never neutral. Every utterance bears traces of the social conditions of its production: the speaker's class, region, education, and identity. Bourdieu's concept of linguistic capital illuminates how language functions in the reproduction of social inequality. Speakers of prestige varieties—Standard English, Received Pronunciation—possess cultural capital convertible to educational and economic advantage. Their speech is heard as intelligent, authoritative, competent. Speakers of stigmatized varieties face the opposite: their knowledge dismissed, their competence doubted, their accent 'corrected.' The linguistic market, like other markets, distributes resources unequally.",
      "Standard languages are themselves political constructs. There is nothing linguistically superior about Standard American English over African American Vernacular English; both are rule-governed systems of equal expressive capacity. The difference is social: one variety is associated with power, institutionalized in education and media; the other is marginalized, its speakers pathologized. The ideology of the standard—the belief that one variety is inherently correct—obscures this social hierarchy, naturalizing what is in fact historical and political. To speak of 'bad grammar' is already to take sides in a struggle over whose language counts.",
      "Critical discourse analysis examines how language constructs and maintains power relations. The passive voice can obscure agency: 'mistakes were made' erases responsibility. Nominalization transforms processes into things: 'ethnic cleansing' converts deliberate killing into an abstract concept. Metaphors frame understanding: speaking of refugees as a 'flood' naturalizes hostile responses. These are not merely stylistic choices; they shape what can be thought and said. To analyze discourse is to ask: who benefits from this way of representing reality?",
      "Yet language is also a site of resistance. Subordinated groups can appropriate dominant codes, develop counterdiscourses, reclaim stigmatized terms. The emergence of new identities often involves linguistic innovation. If language is implicated in domination, it is also a resource for liberation. The question is not whether language has politics, but what politics our linguistic choices enact."
