      "id": "c2-g2-s1",
      "title": "Periodic vs. Loose Sentences",
      "explanation": "A periodic sentence withholds its main clause until the end, building suspense. A loose sentence states its main point first, then adds qualifications.",
      "examples": [
        {
          "type": "periodic",
          "sentence": "Despite the mounting evidence, the relentless criticism, and the growing public outcry, the government maintained its position.",
          "analysis": "Main clause ('the government maintained its position') is delayed, creating emphasis"
        },
        {
          "type": "loose",
          "sentence": "The government maintained its position, despite the mounting evidence, the relentless criticism, and the growing public outcry.",
          "analysis": "Main clause comes first; additional elements trail after"
        }

      "id": "c2-g2-s2",
      "title": "Anaphora and Epistrophe",
      "explanation": "Anaphora repeats words at the beginning of successive clauses; epistrophe repeats them at the end. Both create rhetorical emphasis.",

        {
          "type": "anaphora",
          "sentence": "We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields.",
          "analysis": "Repetition of 'we shall fight' at the beginning of each clause"
        },
        {
          "type": "epistrophe",
          "sentence": "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child.",
          "analysis": "Repetition of 'as a child' at the end of each clause"

      ],
      "effect": "Creates rhythm, emphasis, and memorability in formal and persuasive writing"
    },
    {
      "id": "c2-g2-s3",
      "title": "Chiasmus and Antimetabole",
      "explanation": "Chiasmus reverses the grammatical structure of successive phrases; antimetabole reverses the words themselves.",
      "examples": [
        {
          "type": "chiasmus",
          "sentence": "By day the frolic, and the dance by night.",

      "effect": "Creates a sense of balance and invites reflection on contrasts"
    },
    {
      "id": "c2-g2-s4",
      "title": "Polysyndeton and Asyndeton",
      "explanation": "Polysyndeton uses multiple conjunctions; asyndeton omits them entirely.",

          "type": "polysyndeton",
          "sentence": "He ran and jumped and laughed and shouted.",
