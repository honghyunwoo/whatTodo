      "context": "Literary theory lecture",
      "transcript": "Barthes's proclamation of the death of the author, now over fifty years old, continues to provoke. His central claim—that the meaning of a text resides not in authorial intention but in the process of reading—has become something of a critical commonplace. And yet, the author refuses to die. Biographical criticism persists; readers remain fascinated by the lives behind the works; courts adjudicate authorial intent in copyright cases. Perhaps what Barthes accomplished was not so much the murder of the author as a productive estrangement—forcing us to see that our intuitive equation of meaning with intention is neither natural nor necessary. The author, we might say, has been demoted from origin to one voice among many.",

      "transcript": "There's something paradoxical about nostalgia's contemporary prevalence. We live in a culture obsessed with innovation, with disruption, with the new—and yet we are simultaneously awash in retro aesthetics, reboots, and period dramas. Svetlana Boym distinguished between restorative nostalgia, which seeks to recreate the past, and reflective nostalgia, which dwells in longing itself. The former can be politically dangerous—think of nationalist movements promising to restore past glory. The latter, Boym suggests, has ethical potential: by acknowledging the irretrievability of the past, it opens space for mourning, for irony, for the recognition of our own historical situatedness. Contemporary nostalgia, I would argue, oscillates uneasily between these poles.",
