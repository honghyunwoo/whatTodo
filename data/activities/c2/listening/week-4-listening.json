      "title": "The Concept of Ideology",
      "context": "Political philosophy lecture",
      "transcript": "The concept of ideology has undergone remarkable transformations since Marx first deployed it. For Marx, ideology was false consciousness—the ruling ideas of any epoch being the ideas of the ruling class. But this formulation raises an immediate difficulty: if all thought is ideologically determined, how can Marxism itself escape ideology? Althusser's innovation was to reconceive ideology not as false belief but as lived relation—the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence. On this view, ideology is not simply error to be corrected but the very medium through which subjects are constituted. We do not have ideologies; we are subjects of ideology. This shift from epistemology to ontology has profound implications for political practice. If ideology is not mere deception, then enlightenment—simply showing people the truth—cannot be the path to liberation.",

      "context": "Legal philosophy seminar",
      "transcript": "Carl Schmitt's dictum that sovereign is he who decides on the exception has returned to contemporary political discourse with troubling resonance. For Schmitt, the liberal legal order presupposes normal conditions; it cannot account for its own foundation or for genuine emergencies that suspend the normal order. The sovereign, on this account, is precisely the authority that can declare the exception—suspend ordinary law in the name of preserving the political community itself. Giorgio Agamben has argued that the exception has become the rule in contemporary governance—that the camp, not the city, has become the nomos of the modern. What began as exceptional measures against terrorism have been normalized. The consequence is the figure of homo sacer—bare life that can be killed but not sacrificed, included in the political order only through exclusion. Whether one accepts Agamben's sweeping diagnosis, his analysis forces us to confront how emergency powers, once invoked, prove difficult to revoke.",
