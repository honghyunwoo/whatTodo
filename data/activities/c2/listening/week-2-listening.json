      "title": "The Problem of Induction",
      "context": "Philosophy lecture on epistemology",
      "transcript": "The problem of induction, as articulated by Hume, strikes at the very foundation of empirical knowledge. We observe that the sun has risen every day of recorded history, and from this we infer that it will rise tomorrow. But what justifies this inference? We cannot appeal to logic, for it is not a contradiction to suppose the sun might not rise. Nor can we appeal to experience, for that would be circular—we would be using induction to justify induction. Some philosophers have sought to dissolve rather than solve this problem, arguing that our inductive practices are constitutive of rationality itself. To ask for a justification of induction, they contend, is to misunderstand what justification means. But this pragmatic dissolution leaves many unsatisfied, for it seems to concede that our most fundamental beliefs rest on nothing more solid than habit and convention.",

      "context": "Graduate seminar discussion",
      "transcript": "What's fascinating about this debate is not merely its content but its form. Notice how we've been engaging in what we might call second-order philosophy—philosophy about philosophy. We're not just asking whether moral facts exist; we're asking what it would mean for such facts to exist, what counts as evidence in ethical discourse, and whether our ordinary moral language commits us to any particular metaphysical view. This meta-ethical turn, characteristic of much twentieth-century philosophy, reflects a broader worry: perhaps many traditional philosophical puzzles arise from linguistic confusion rather than deep features of reality. Wittgenstein's therapeutic conception of philosophy invites us to dissolve problems rather than solve them—to see that the fly was never really trapped in the bottle.",
