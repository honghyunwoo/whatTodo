      "context": "Cognitive science lecture",
      "transcript": "The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis—that language shapes thought—has been one of the most productive and contentious ideas in cognitive science. The strong version, linguistic determinism, claims that language determines the categories of thought, making certain ideas literally unthinkable in certain languages. This has been largely discredited: we can think things we cannot easily say, and translation between languages is possible, if imperfect. But the weak version, linguistic relativism, has found empirical support. Studies show that speakers of languages with different color terms perceive color boundaries differently. Russian speakers, who have separate words for light and dark blue, discriminate these colors faster than English speakers. Languages with absolute spatial terms—'north' instead of 'left'—produce speakers with remarkable orientation abilities. The question is no longer whether language affects thought, but how, and how much. My own view is that language is like a well-worn path through a forest: you can leave the path, but you're much more likely to follow it.",

      "transcript": "Frege's puzzle remains foundational to philosophy of language. Consider: 'The morning star is the morning star' is trivially true, uninformative. But 'The morning star is the evening star' is informative—it was a genuine astronomical discovery that both refer to Venus. If meaning were just reference, these sentences would have the same meaning, since both terms refer to the same object. Frege's solution was to distinguish sense from reference: terms can have the same reference but different senses—different modes of presentation of the same object. This elegant solution has its own difficulties. What are senses? Are they mental entities? Abstract objects? How do they determine reference? Kripke's causal theory offered an alternative: names refer not through descriptions but through causal chains connecting our use to an original baptism. But this too faces challenges: how do we explain the informativeness of identity statements without senses? The debate continues to structure work in semantics and philosophy of mind.",
