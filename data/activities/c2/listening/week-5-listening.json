      "title": "The Realism-Antirealism Debate",
      "context": "Philosophy of science seminar",
      "transcript": "The question of scientific realism—whether our best theories approximately describe reality as it is—has proven remarkably difficult to settle. Realists point to the predictive success of mature sciences: general relativity, for instance, predicted phenomena no one had observed, like gravitational lensing. This, they argue, would be a miracle if the theory weren't at least approximately true. Antirealists counter with the pessimistic meta-induction: the history of science is a graveyard of once-successful theories now considered false. If past theories we believed were true turned out to be false, what grounds do we have for thinking our current theories are different? Perhaps theories are merely instruments that 'save the phenomena' without describing underlying reality. The debate matters because it shapes how we understand the epistemic authority of science: are we making progress toward truth, or merely constructing increasingly sophisticated tools?",

      "title": "The Sociology of Scientific Knowledge",
      "context": "Academic lecture",
      "transcript": "The strong programme in the sociology of scientific knowledge, associated with David Bloor and Barry Barnes, makes a radical claim: that the content of scientific beliefs—not just their social organization—can be explained sociologically. Traditional accounts privilege the success of true beliefs; the strong programme insists on symmetry—that true and false beliefs should be explained by the same types of causes. The rationalist protests: surely the reason scientists believe in electrons is that electrons exist! But the sociologist of science responds: that explanation is available only retrospectively. At the moment of belief formation, the scientist cannot appeal to how things will eventually turn out. The debate is often caricatured as science versus relativism, but the more subtle point concerns the relationship between reasons and causes. Even if scientific beliefs are warranted by evidence, we can still ask what social conditions enabled that evidence to be recognized as such.",
