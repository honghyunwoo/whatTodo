      "modelParagraph": "A formidable objection to moral objectivism points to widespread cross-cultural disagreement: if moral facts are objective, why do different societies reach such divergent moral conclusions? This challenge carries significant weight, and any adequate defense of moral objectivism must address it directly. However, I would argue that disagreement does not entail the absence of truth. Persistent disagreement exists in empirical domains—consider historical disputes in cosmology—without undermining the objectivity of astronomical facts. Furthermore, much apparent moral disagreement dissolves upon closer inspection: societies often share core moral principles while differing on their empirical application. The existence of moral progress—the near-universal rejection of slavery, for instance—is itself difficult to explain on a relativist view, whereas moral objectivism can account for it as genuine moral discovery.",

If this is correct, it places significant constraints on how we should approach moral disagreement: not as a clash of incommensurable preferences, but as a joint inquiry into truths that await discovery. The metaethical stakes of this question extend, therefore, to the practical question of how we should engage with those whose moral convictions differ from our own.",
