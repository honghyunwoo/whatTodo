    "sampleResponse": "The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis Revisited: A Synthetic Overview\n\nThe relationship between language and thought has generated one of linguistics' most productive debates. The strong form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis—that language determines thought—found few contemporary defenders after Berlin and Kay's (1969) demonstration of universal constraints on color naming. Yet recent empirical work has revived interest in weaker versions of linguistic relativism. Boroditsky (2001, 2011) has provided compelling evidence that speakers of languages with different spatial and temporal metaphors exhibit corresponding differences in non-linguistic reasoning tasks. Her work suggests that habitual patterns of speech do influence habitual patterns of thought, even if they don't constrain what thoughts are possible.\n\nLucy (1992, 1997) offers perhaps the most sophisticated contemporary defense of relativism, arguing that we must distinguish between semiotic, structural, and functional levels of influence, each requiring different methodological approaches. His work on Yucatec Maya demonstrates that grammatical differences in number marking correlate with differences in object categorization—a finding that connects linguistic structure to cognitive consequences.\n\nYet skeptics remain. Pinker (1994) argues that thought is essentially independent of language, occurring in a 'mentalese' that is then translated into natural language for communication. McWhorter (2014) contends that apparent relativistic effects are better explained by cultural practices that co-occur with linguistic differences.\n\nThe current consensus, if one exists, is perhaps best captured by Slobin's (1996) 'thinking for speaking' hypothesis: language doesn't determine thought in general but shapes attention during the process of linguistic encoding. This modest but empirically tractable position frames much contemporary research."
