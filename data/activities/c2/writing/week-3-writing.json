Scholars have examined its psychological appeal, its political instrumentalization, and its technological amplification through social media platforms. These studies have advanced our understanding of misinformation, but they share a common limitation: they treat 'truth' and 'falsity' as unproblematic categories. This paper draws on insights from speech act theory to complicate this binary, arguing that fake news functions less as false content than as a degraded discursive mode—one that undermines the very possibility of meaningful public communication.",
