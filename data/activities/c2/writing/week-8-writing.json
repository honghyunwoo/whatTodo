    "sampleResponse": "Tense and Temporality: How Language Shapes Our Experience of Time\n\nIntroduction: The Linguistic Construction of Temporal Experience\n\nWe inhabit time as fish inhabit water—so immersed that we rarely notice the medium. Time seems simply given: an objective feature of the world that we passively experience. Yet this immediacy is deceptive. Between raw temporal experience and conscious understanding lies a vast apparatus of linguistic and conceptual structure. We do not merely experience time; we interpret it, and we interpret it through language.\n\nThis book examines how linguistic resources shape temporal understanding. Its central claim is that different languages offer different architectures for constructing temporal experience—and that these differences matter for thought, memory, and action. English speakers, with their obligatory tense marking, cannot speak of an event without locating it temporally. Speakers of tenseless languages like Mandarin organize temporal information through different, equally systematic means. These are not merely alternative ways of expressing the same underlying experience but genuinely different ways of organizing that experience.\n\nThe argument proceeds at three levels. At the linguistic level, I analyze how temporal information is encoded across typologically diverse languages, drawing on fieldwork with speakers of Hopi, Aymara, and several African languages alongside familiar European cases. At the cognitive level, I examine experimental evidence suggesting that linguistic differences correlate with differences in non-linguistic temporal cognition—in memory, planning, and counterfactual reasoning. At the philosophical level, I argue that these findings have implications for debates about the nature of temporal experience and the possibility of objective temporal knowledge.\n\nI should be clear at the outset about what I am not claiming. I am not arguing that language determines thought—that speakers of one language cannot think what speakers of another can express. The strong Whorfian hypothesis has been rightly abandoned. My claim is more modest but, I hope, still significant: that language makes certain ways of thinking about time more cognitively available, more default, more habitual. We can step outside our linguistic habits, but stepping outside takes effort. The path of least cognitive resistance follows the grooves our language has worn."
