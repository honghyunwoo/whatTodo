    "text": "David: Hey Sophie, did you hear about that viral news story that turned out to be completely false?\nSophie: Which one? There have been so many lately. Social media has made it incredibly easy for misinformation to spread.\nDavid: It was that story about the celebrity scandal. By the time the truth came out, millions of people had already shared it.\nSophie: That's the problem with online news. People tend to share articles before they've even read them properly. I've started being much more careful about verifying information.\nDavid: How do you do that? I find it hard to know which sources to trust anymore.\nSophie: Well, I've developed a few habits. First, I always check if the story is being reported by multiple reliable outlets. If only one obscure website is reporting something sensational, that's a red flag.\nDavid: That makes sense. I've noticed that tabloids often exaggerate stories to get more clicks.\nSophie: Exactly. I also look at when the article was published. Sometimes people share old news as if it had just happened.\nDavid: I hadn't thought about that. What about bias? Even reputable newspapers seem to have political leanings.\nSophie: That's true. I try to read the same story from different perspectives. If a left-leaning paper and a right-leaning paper are both reporting the same basic facts, I feel more confident the information is accurate.\nDavid: That sounds time-consuming, though.\nSophie: It is, but I've realized I'd rather spend a few extra minutes checking something than spread false information. Before social media, journalists had been the main gatekeepers of information. Now everyone can be a publisher.\nDavid: And not everyone follows journalistic ethics. I read that some countries have started teaching media literacy in schools.\nSophie: That's a great idea. We had never needed these skills as much as we do now. Our grandparents trusted their newspapers, but we can't afford to be so trusting anymore.\nDavid: It's ironic, isn't it? We have access to more information than ever, but we're less sure what's true.\nSophie: The key is to stay skeptical without becoming cynical. Critical thinking has become an essential survival skill in the digital age.",
