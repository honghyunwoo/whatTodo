    "text": "Host: Welcome back to Global Perspectives. Today we're discussing the future of travel with journalist Sarah Chen. Sarah, what changes do you expect to see?\n\nSarah: Thanks for having me. Well, by 2030, I believe travel will have transformed dramatically. Sustainable tourism will have become the norm rather than the exception. We'll be seeing far more eco-friendly options.\n\nHost: That's interesting. What about technology's role?\n\nSarah: Technology will be changing everything. By the end of this decade, artificial intelligence will have revolutionized how we plan trips. At any given moment, millions of people will be using AI assistants to book personalized travel experiences. Virtual reality previews will have become standard for hotels and destinations.\n\nHost: Some argue globalization has made travel too homogeneous. What's your view?\n\nSarah: That's a valid concern. By 2040, many fear that authentic cultural experiences will have disappeared. However, I'm more optimistic. Communities will be working harder to preserve their heritage. By then, we'll have developed better ways to balance tourism with cultural preservation.\n\nHost: What about space tourism?\n\nSarah: By 2035, commercial space travel will have become accessible to more people—though still expensive. This time next year, several companies will be offering suborbital flights. In a few decades, we might even be visiting space hotels. By the end of the century, humans will have been traveling to space for tourism for fifty years or more.\n\nHost: How will climate change affect travel?\n\nSarah: This is crucial. By 2050, rising sea levels will have changed many coastal destinations. Some places we visit today will have become inaccessible. People will be traveling to see endangered environments before they're gone. By then, carbon-neutral flights will have become mandatory in many countries.\n\nHost: Any advice for travelers today?\n\nSarah: Travel consciously. By the time you're my age, the world will have changed significantly. The experiences available now may not exist in the future. But also remember: by then, we'll have discovered new destinations and created new ways to explore our interconnected world.",
