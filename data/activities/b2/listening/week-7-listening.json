    "text": "Presenter: Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to talk about what it takes to build a successful company. It is leadership that makes the difference between a good company and a great one.\n\nNow, what do successful leaders have in common? What they all share is a clear vision. Never have I met a successful CEO who didn't know exactly where they wanted their company to go. It was Steve Jobs who said that innovation distinguishes leaders from followers, and he was absolutely right.\n\nBut vision alone isn't enough. Only by building strong teams can leaders achieve their goals. Not only must leaders inspire their employees, but they must also create an environment where innovation can flourish. So important is company culture that it can determine whether a business succeeds or fails.\n\nLet me give you an example. It was in 2010 that a small startup nearly went bankrupt. What saved them was not a new product, but a complete change in leadership approach. Rarely does a company recover from such a crisis, but this one did. The reason they succeeded is that the new CEO focused on what really mattered: the people.\n\nAll successful leaders understand that employees are their most valuable asset. What these leaders do differently is invest in their teams. Only when you trust your employees will they give their best work. Such was the transformation at this company that they went from near-failure to industry leader in just five years.\n\nSo, what is the key takeaway? It is not technology or capital that drives success—it is people. The thing that matters most is creating a workplace where talented individuals want to contribute. Only then will your business truly thrive.",
