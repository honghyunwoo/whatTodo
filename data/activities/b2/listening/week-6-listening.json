    "text": "Interviewer: Dr. Martinez, many people struggle with maintaining healthy habits. What advice do you have?\nDr. Martinez: Well, I often see patients who say, 'If I had started exercising earlier, I would be in better shape now.' It's a common regret. But it's never too late to make changes.\nInterviewer: What about diet? That seems to be a challenge for many.\nDr. Martinez: Absolutely. If people had understood the importance of nutrition when they were younger, they wouldn't be dealing with so many health issues today. The choices we make in our twenties and thirties affect our health decades later.\nInterviewer: Some patients avoid medical check-ups. What would you say to them?\nDr. Martinez: If someone weren't so afraid of doctors, they would have detected problems much earlier. I've seen cases where early detection could have made a huge difference. Prevention is always better than treatment.\nInterviewer: What about mental health? It seems more people are talking about it now.\nDr. Martinez: Yes, and I'm glad. If society had taken mental health seriously earlier, we wouldn't be facing such a crisis now. Stress, anxiety, and burnout have become epidemic. Had we invested in mental health support decades ago, millions of people would be healthier today.\nInterviewer: How does sleep affect overall health?\nDr. Martinez: Tremendously. If people had prioritized sleep instead of working long hours, they wouldn't be suffering from chronic fatigue and related conditions. Sleep is not a luxury; it's a necessity.\nInterviewer: What's the biggest mistake people make?\nDr. Martinez: Ignoring symptoms. If they weren't so busy, they would have addressed health issues before they became serious. I always tell patients: your body sends signals. Listen to them.\nInterviewer: Any final thoughts?\nDr. Martinez: If I were giving one piece of advice, it would be this: don't wait for a health scare to make changes. If more people had adopted healthy habits early, healthcare systems wouldn't be so overwhelmed today. Small, consistent changes now can prevent major problems later.",
