    "text": "Health is one of our most valuable assets, yet many of us realize its importance only when problems arise. Looking back at society's choices over recent decades, it's clear that different decisions would have led to healthier outcomes today.\n\nIf governments had invested more in preventive healthcare programs, we wouldn't be spending such enormous amounts on treating preventable chronic diseases now. Had public health campaigns emphasized nutrition and exercise earlier, the current obesity epidemic might not be so severe. The healthcare system is overwhelmed precisely because reactive treatment was prioritized over proactive prevention.\n\nOn an individual level, many people face similar regrets. If I weren't so focused on my career, I would have developed better exercise habits years ago. This is a common pattern: people sacrifice their health for short-term goals, only to face long-term consequences. Mental health presents another critical area where earlier intervention could have made a significant difference. Had society taken stress and burnout seriously decades ago, millions wouldn't be suffering from anxiety and depression today.\n\nHowever, it's never too late to make changes. If we start prioritizing sleep, nutrition, and mental wellbeing now, future generations will benefit from our improved awareness. The lesson is clear: the health choices we make today determine our wellbeing tomorrow.",
