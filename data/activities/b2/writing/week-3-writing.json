    "text": "The 2010 Haiti earthquake remains one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history, claiming over 200,000 lives. While no one could have prevented the earthquake itself, the devastating death toll could have been significantly reduced if different decisions had been made.\n\nFirst, if building codes had been properly enforced in Port-au-Prince, many structures would not have collapsed so catastrophically. The city's rapid growth had outpaced safety regulations, and thousands died in poorly constructed buildings that could have been built to withstand seismic activity.\n\nSecond, the international response, though substantial, arrived too late for many victims. If emergency response systems had been better coordinated before the disaster, rescue teams could have saved more lives in the critical first 72 hours. Had pre-positioned supplies been available in the region, immediate relief would have reached survivors faster.\n\nFinally, if long-term development investment had strengthened local infrastructure and healthcare systems, the country would have been more resilient. Economic inequality had left Haiti vulnerable, and poverty magnified every aspect of the tragedy.\n\nThese scenarios teach us that disaster preparedness is not optional. If we had learned these lessons earlier, future tragedies might be prevented or minimized. The cost of prevention is always lower than the cost of recovery.",
