  "passage": {
    "text": "Throughout history, humanitarian crises have tested the international community's ability to respond effectively. Looking back at these events, we can identify critical moments when different decisions might have led to dramatically different outcomes.\n\nThe Rwanda genocide of 1994 remains one of the most tragic examples of failed intervention. In just 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people were killed. The United Nations had peacekeeping forces in the country, but they were not authorized to take action. If the UN Security Council had granted permission for intervention, countless lives could have been saved. If major powers had not withdrawn their forces at the crucial moment, the violence might have been stopped before it escalated.\n\nThe Syrian refugee crisis, which began in 2011, presented another set of challenges. If neighboring countries had received more international support earlier, they would have been better equipped to handle the influx of displaced people. If wealthy nations had established more legal pathways for refugees, fewer people would have risked dangerous sea crossings. The human cost of delayed action has been immense.\n\nClimate-related disasters have added a new dimension to humanitarian challenges. If governments had implemented the recommendations from early climate science, many communities that have been displaced by rising sea levels and extreme weather might still be in their homes. The link between environmental degradation and human displacement had been understood for decades, yet action remained insufficient.\n\nEconomic inequality has also been at the root of many crises. If international development programs had focused more on building local capacity rather than providing short-term aid, sustainable progress could have been achieved. If trade agreements had been structured more fairly, developing economies might have grown stronger and more resilient.\n\nThe lessons from these events are clear. Early warning systems exist, but the political will to act on them has often been lacking. If decision-makers had trusted expert assessments, preventive measures could have been implemented. If the true cost of inaction had been calculated upfront, the investment in prevention would have seemed far more reasonable.\n\nMoving forward, the international community must learn from these missed opportunities. The third conditional of history is filled with 'ifs' that represent real suffering that could have been prevented. Our task now is to ensure that future generations do not have to ask the same questions about our era.",
