  "passage": {
    "text": "The twenty-first century has brought remarkable medical advances, yet paradoxically, chronic diseases are on the rise. Many health experts argue that if we had maintained traditional lifestyles, we wouldn't be facing the current health crisis.\n\nThe sedentary nature of modern work is a significant factor. If people hadn't transitioned to office jobs that require sitting for eight hours or more, rates of obesity and back problems would be lower today. Research indicates that even regular exercise cannot fully compensate for prolonged sitting. Had our ancestors known how harmful inactivity would become, they might have designed cities differently.\n\nDiet has changed dramatically as well. If processed foods hadn't become so readily available and affordable, people wouldn't be consuming so much sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. The convenience of fast food has come at a significant health cost. Many doctors wish they could prescribe healthy eating with the same authority as medication.\n\nMental health presents another challenge. If workplaces were more supportive, employees wouldn't be experiencing such high levels of stress and burnout. The constant connectivity enabled by smartphones means that work never truly ends. Had technology developers considered the psychological impact, they might have built in more safeguards.\n\nSleep deprivation has become normalized in modern society. If people hadn't adopted the mentality that sleep is wasted time, they would be more productive and healthier. Studies show that chronic sleep deficit affects everything from immune function to decision-making. Were adequate sleep prioritized, many accidents and health issues could be prevented.\n\nThe healthcare system itself contributes to the problem. If governments had invested more in preventive care, they wouldn't be spending so much on treating preventable diseases now. The focus on reactive rather than proactive medicine has proven costly both financially and in terms of human suffering.\n\nHowever, awareness is growing. If current trends continue, the next generation may make different choices. Had previous generations had access to the information we have today, they would have made better decisions. The lesson is clear: what we do today determines our health tomorrow.",
