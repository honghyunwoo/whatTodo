      "modelResponse": "I would argue that universities should maintain a balance between vocational training and liberal arts education, rather than prioritizing one over the other. The evidence suggests that liberal arts education develops critical thinking and adaptability—skills increasingly valued in a rapidly changing job market. While some might contend that vocational training offers more immediate employability, this overlooks the fact that many technical skills become obsolete quickly, whereas foundational analytical abilities remain relevant throughout one's career. In conclusion, a holistic approach that integrates both practical skills and theoretical foundations best prepares students for long-term success."
