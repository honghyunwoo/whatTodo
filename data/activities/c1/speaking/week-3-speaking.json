We've observed an increase from 72 percent in 2020 to 89 percent in 2023—that's a 17-percentage-point improvement. What's particularly noteworthy is that the steepest rise occurred between 2021 and 2022, which coincided with our implementation of the new feedback system. While these figures are certainly encouraging, we should be mindful that satisfaction metrics can be influenced by various external factors."
