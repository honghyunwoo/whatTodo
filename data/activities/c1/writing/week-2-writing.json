      ],
      "modelAnswer": "The literature on remote work productivity presents a nuanced picture. While Chen (2021) emphasizes the productivity gains from eliminated commute time and schedule flexibility, Williams (2022) cautions that this flexibility can paradoxically lead to overwork when work-life boundaries become indistinct. Furthermore, Patel (2020) suggests that these effects are not uniform, noting significant variation across industries and roles. Taken together, these findings indicate that the relationship between remote work and productivity is mediated by contextual factors and individual circumstances.",

      "modelAnswer": "A review of the literature reveals several notable gaps that warrant further investigation. First, the predominant focus on large corporations leaves the experiences of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) relatively unexplored, despite their significant contribution to global employment. Second, the concentration on Western contexts limits our understanding of how diversity dynamics operate in collectivist or non-Western organizational cultures. Third, the prevalent use of quantitative methods, while valuable for establishing correlations, provides limited insight into the mechanisms through which diversity affects organizational outcomes. Future research employing qualitative or mixed-methods approaches in diverse geographic and organizational contexts would significantly advance our understanding of this phenomenon."
