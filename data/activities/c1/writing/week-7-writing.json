    "sampleResponse": "Executive Summary: CRM Implementation Proposal\n\nProblem\nOur sales team manages 5,000+ customer relationships using disconnected spreadsheets, resulting in data inconsistencies, lost opportunities, and approximately 15 hours per week spent on manual data consolidation. Customer response times average 48 hours—twice industry standard. We estimate this inefficiency costs $200,000 annually in lost sales and productivity.\n\nProposed Solution\nWe propose implementing Salesforce CRM, configured for our specific workflow, with full integration to our email and calendar systems. The solution will provide:\n- Unified customer database accessible to all team members\n- Automated lead tracking and opportunity management\n- Real-time reporting and pipeline visibility\n- Email integration for automatic activity logging\n\nExpected Benefits\n- 60% reduction in administrative time (9 hours/week reclaimed)\n- Customer response time reduced to under 24 hours\n- 15% increase in conversion rate through improved follow-up\n- ROI breakeven within 8 months\n\nInvestment Required\n- Implementation cost: $45,000 (one-time)\n- Annual subscription: $24,000\n- Training: $8,000\n- Total first-year cost: $77,000\n\nTimeline\n- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Configuration and data migration\n- Phase 2 (Weeks 5-6): Integration and testing\n- Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8): Training and go-live\n\nRecommendation\nWe recommend proceeding with Phase 1 immediately to achieve go-live by end of Q2. Detailed implementation plan and risk assessment follow in Section 3."
