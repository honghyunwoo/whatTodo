Market Size: The target region represents 680 million consumers with a growing middle class projected to reach 350 million by 2030. Our product category is growing at 18% annually in these markets.\n\n2. Competitive Positioning: Only two major competitors have established presence. Early entry gives us 18-24 months' first-mover advantage in Vietnam.\n\n3. Cost Structure: Operating costs are 40% lower than our current markets, with access to a skilled workforce graduating 500,000 engineers annually.\n\nRisks and Mitigation:\n- Regulatory complexity: We recommend partnering with local distributors initially (reducing upfront investment by 60%)\n- Currency volatility: Treasury has identified hedging strategies to limit exposure\n- Cultural adaptation: Market research budget of $200K allocated for localization\n\nInvestment Required: $3.5M over 18 months\nProjected ROI: 180% by Year 3, breakeven at Month 18\n\nDecision Requested: Approve Phase 1 funding ($1.2M) to establish Vietnam operations by end of Q2.
