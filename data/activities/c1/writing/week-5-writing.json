    "sampleResponse": "Urban Green Spaces and Air Quality: A Multi-City Analysis\n\nBackground: Urban air pollution contributes to millions of premature deaths annually. Green spaces have been proposed as a nature-based solution for improving urban air quality, but the magnitude and mechanisms of this benefit remain contested.\n\nObjective: This study investigates the relationship between urban green space coverage and air quality indicators across 50 major cities globally.\n\nMethods: We combined satellite-derived green space data with ground-based air quality measurements (PM2.5, NO2, and O3) from 2015-2023. Multiple regression models controlled for population density, industrial activity, traffic patterns, and meteorological variables. Spatial analysis examined the relationship between proximity to green spaces and local air quality.\n\nResults: Cities with green space coverage exceeding 20% showed PM2.5 levels 12% lower than comparable cities with less coverage (p < 0.001). The effect was strongest within 500 meters of parks larger than 5 hectares. However, the relationship varied significantly by climate zone, with stronger effects in temperate regions. NO2 reductions were significant only in cities with extensive tree canopy rather than grass-dominated green spaces.\n\nConclusions: Urban green spaces can contribute measurably to air quality improvement, but effect size depends on green space type, size, and configuration. These findings support targeted investment in urban forests rather than general greening. Policymakers should prioritize tree canopy expansion in high-pollution areas within temperate climate zones for maximum air quality benefit."
