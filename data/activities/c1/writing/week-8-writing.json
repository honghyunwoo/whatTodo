    "sampleResponse": "The Case Against Mandatory Identity Verification\n\nWhen harassment drove her off social media, my friend didn't want anonymity abolished—she wanted it protected. Her harassers used their real names proudly. Anonymity let her rebuild a presence without them finding her.\n\nProposals to require real-name verification on social media sound sensible: accountability would reduce abuse, the argument goes. If trolls couldn't hide, they wouldn't troll. But this well-intentioned idea would cause more harm than it prevents.\n\nFirst, it wouldn't work. The most toxic behavior often comes from people using their real names—and proudly so. Studies of Facebook, which has long required real names, show harassment rates comparable to more anonymous platforms. Bad actors determined to cause harm will create fake IDs or steal others'.\n\nSecond, it would endanger vulnerable users. Activists in authoritarian countries use anonymity to organize without persecution. LGBTQ youth in unsupportive families use it to find community safely. Domestic violence survivors use it to rebuild lives away from abusers. Mandatory verification hands these users to those who would harm them.\n\nThird, it conflates anonymity with the absence of accountability. Platforms can—and do—enforce community standards without knowing users' legal names. Account suspensions, content removal, and IP bans address behavior without requiring government ID.\n\nThe real solution isn't eliminating anonymity but investing in better moderation, clearer standards, and tools that give users more control over their experiences. These approaches address abuse without sacrificing the legitimate benefits of pseudonymity.\n\nBefore we dismantle online anonymity in the name of safety, we should ask: whose safety, and at whose expense? For many users, anonymity isn't the problem—it's the protection."
