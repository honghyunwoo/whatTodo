      "modelSummary": "This brief recommends addressing the housing affordability crisis through increased zoning density near transit stations combined with targeted subsidies for first-time buyers earning below median income. With home prices rising 45% against 12% wage growth over five years, immediate action is necessary. While rent control offers short-term relief, evidence suggests it reduces housing supply long-term. The proposed approach balances market-based solutions with direct assistance, projected to create 5,000 new affordable units within three years while helping 2,000 families enter homeownership.",

      ],
      "modelParagraph": "The case for mandatory financial literacy education rests on substantial evidence. National surveys reveal a troubling knowledge gap: only 24 percent of adults can correctly answer basic questions about interest rates, inflation, and risk diversification. Crucially, research demonstrates that early intervention works—students who completed financial literacy courses accumulated 15 percent less credit card debt than their peers. International comparisons further support this approach: countries that have implemented mandatory financial education, including Australia and the Netherlands, consistently report higher household savings rates. Given this evidence, requiring financial literacy coursework in high schools represents a cost-effective investment in long-term economic well-being."
