    "sampleResponse": "Re: Comments on Proposed Rule on Mandatory Paid Family Leave\n\nDear Administrator Chen:\n\nThe Small Business Alliance submits these comments in response to the proposed rule on mandatory paid family leave published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2024.\n\nPosition: While we support the policy objective of providing workers with adequate family leave, we respectfully submit that the proposed rule, as drafted, would impose disproportionate burdens on small businesses. We urge the agency to adopt modifications that achieve the rule's goals while preserving small business viability.\n\nSupporting Analysis:\n\nFirst, compliance costs would be substantially higher for small businesses on a per-employee basis. Our member survey indicates that businesses with fewer than 50 employees would face implementation costs averaging $1,500 per employee—three times the per-employee cost for larger firms due to lack of economies of scale.\n\nSecond, the loss of a single employee for 12 weeks creates greater operational disruption for small businesses, where individual employees often possess unique institutional knowledge and fulfill multiple functions.\n\nThird, small businesses typically lack the financial reserves to fund extended leave while maintaining operations, particularly in service industries where customer relationships depend on personnel continuity.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nWe propose the following modifications:\n(a) Exempt businesses with fewer than 25 employees from the mandatory provisions;\n(b) Provide a 36-month implementation timeline for businesses with 25-50 employees; and\n(c) Establish a tax credit to offset compliance costs for qualifying small businesses.\n\nThese modifications would preserve the rule's benefits for the majority of workers while preventing unintended harm to small business employment.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMaria Johnson\nPolicy Director\nSmall Business Alliance"
