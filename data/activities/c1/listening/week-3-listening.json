      "context": "Radio interview with a health policy expert",
      "transcript": "Well, the situation is considerably more nuanced than the headlines suggest. Yes, we're seeing rising healthcare costs, but attributing this solely to administrative inefficiency, as some commentators have done, oversimplifies a complex issue. There are structural factors at play—an aging population, the cost of new medical technologies, and frankly, the fee-for-service model itself creates perverse incentives. That said, I wouldn't dismiss administrative costs entirely. Some estimates suggest they account for up to thirty percent of total healthcare spending. But the solution isn't simply to cut administrators—it's to redesign systems so that administrative work becomes less necessary in the first place.",

      "transcript": "I want to push back on that characterization. It's not that critics of standardized testing are opposed to accountability—quite the contrary. What we're questioning is whether these particular instruments actually measure what they claim to measure. When you have schools narrowing their curriculum to teach to the test, when you see creative subjects and physical education being marginalized, you have to ask: is this the kind of accountability we want? The irony is that in trying to measure educational quality, we may actually be degrading it. Now, I grant that we need some way of assessing student progress and school performance. But surely we can develop assessment systems that don't have these distorting effects.",
