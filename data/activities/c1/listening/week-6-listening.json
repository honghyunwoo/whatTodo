      "transcript": "Justice Martinez: Counsel, I'd like to press you on the limiting principle. If we accept your argument that the Commerce Clause permits Congress to mandate this activity, what activity could it not mandate? Attorney: Your Honor, the distinction lies in the unique characteristics of the healthcare market. Everyone will eventually require healthcare; no one can opt out of the market entirely. Justice Martinez: But couldn't that reasoning apply to food markets? Everyone needs food. Attorney: The difference, Your Honor, is that the timing of healthcare consumption is unpredictable. Uncompensated emergency care shifts costs to others in a way that food consumption does not. Justice Lee: But aren't you asking us to make economic policy judgments that are properly left to the legislature? Attorney: Not at all, Your Honor. We're asking only that the Court apply its established Commerce Clause precedents, which have consistently held that Congress may regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.",

As you know, proxy advisory firms have raised concerns about our board composition and executive compensation practices. The governance committee recommends three changes: first, separating the CEO and Chair positions; second, implementing a majority voting standard for director elections replacing the current plurality standard; and third, establishing a mandatory clawback policy for executive compensation in the event of financial restatement. These changes align our practices with institutional investor expectations and should reduce the risk of adverse proxy recommendations. The floor is now open for discussion. Director Park: While I support the first two recommendations, I have reservations about the clawback provision. Wouldn't that make executive recruitment more difficult? Chair Williams: That's a fair concern. However, our compensation consultants advise that clawback provisions have become standard among our peer companies and haven't materially affected recruitment.",
