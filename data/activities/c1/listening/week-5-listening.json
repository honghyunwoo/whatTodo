      "transcript": "The latest IPCC synthesis report consolidates findings from working groups on physical science, impacts, and mitigation. The headline findings are stark: we are on track for approximately 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming by century's end under current policies—well above the 1.5 degree target of the Paris Agreement. However, the report also notes that deep, rapid emissions cuts could still limit warming to 1.5 degrees, though this window is closing rapidly. What's particularly concerning is the updated assessment of tipping points—self-reinforcing feedback loops that could accelerate warming beyond model predictions. These include Amazon dieback, permafrost methane release, and ice sheet destabilization. The report emphasizes that every fraction of a degree matters: the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees represents millions of additional climate refugees, significantly more species extinction, and substantially greater economic damage.",

      "title": "Renewable Energy Policy Debate",
      "context": "Panel discussion",
      "transcript": "The transition to renewable energy raises complex questions about grid reliability, economic disruption, and social equity. Critics argue that intermittency—the sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow—makes renewables unsuitable as baseload power. Proponents counter that advances in battery storage, grid interconnection, and demand-response technologies are rapidly addressing this limitation. There's also the jobs question: while renewable energy creates more jobs per unit of energy than fossil fuels, these jobs are often in different locations, requiring just transition policies that support affected communities. Finally, there's the question of who bears the costs. Subsidies for renewables have historically benefited wealthier households who can afford solar panels and electric vehicles. If we're serious about a just transition, we need policies that ensure the benefits of clean energy are equitably distributed—that low-income communities aren't left behind as the energy system transforms.",
