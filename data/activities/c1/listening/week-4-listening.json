      "transcript": "TechGlobal reported mixed results in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue exceeding analyst expectations at 42.3 billion dollars, while earnings per share fell short at 2.17 versus the projected 2.35. The shortfall was attributed primarily to increased R&D spending, which the company insists will drive long-term growth. CFO Sarah Chen noted that cloud services revenue grew 34 percent year-over-year, offsetting declines in hardware sales. The company also announced a 15 billion dollar share buyback program, which some analysts view as a signal of confidence while others question whether the capital could be better deployed elsewhere.",

      "transcript": "The Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates steady at 5.25 to 5.5 percent was largely anticipated, but what surprised markets was the hawkish tone of Chair Powell's subsequent remarks. While acknowledging that inflation has moderated from its peaks, Powell emphasized that the committee isn't confident enough to begin cutting rates. The dot plot now suggests just three cuts in the coming year, down from four in the previous projection. Bond yields rose immediately following the announcement, while equities pulled back. For consumers, this means mortgage rates, auto loans, and credit card APRs are likely to remain elevated through at least the first half of the year.",
