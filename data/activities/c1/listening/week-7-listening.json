      "transcript": "Today we're introducing our next-generation AI assistant. What sets this apart from previous versions—and from competitors—is its multimodal capability. It doesn't just process text; it understands images, audio, and video in context. More importantly, it reasons across these modalities. Show it a chart and ask a question; it will analyze the visual data and provide insights. The second breakthrough is contextual memory. Previous AI systems treated each interaction as isolated. Our new architecture maintains context across sessions, learning your preferences and building on past conversations. Privacy is paramount here: all personalization occurs on-device, with no data transmitted to our servers. Finally, we've dramatically reduced latency. Real-time interaction requires responses in under 300 milliseconds. Our new inference engine achieves sub-200 millisecond response times on consumer hardware.",

      "transcript": "The semiconductor shortage has exposed critical vulnerabilities in global supply chains. The concentration of advanced chip manufacturing in Taiwan—particularly TSMC's dominance of sub-7-nanometer production—represents a single point of failure for the entire tech industry. Companies are responding in two ways. First, inventory strategies have shifted from just-in-time to just-in-case, with firms stockpiling chips despite the working capital implications. Second, we're seeing massive investment in domestic manufacturing capacity. The US CHIPS Act allocates 52 billion dollars to rebuild American semiconductor production. Intel's new Arizona fabs, Samsung's Texas facility, and TSMC's Arizona plant all reflect this reshoring trend. But there's a catch: advanced fabs take years to build and require specialized talent that's in short supply. The skills gap may prove more challenging than the capital investment.",
