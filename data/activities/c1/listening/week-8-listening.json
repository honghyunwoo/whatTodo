      "transcript": "The challenge we face isn't simply that false information exists—it's that our information ecosystem actively rewards it. Content that generates strong emotional responses spreads faster than accurate, nuanced reporting. The economic model of digital advertising incentivizes engagement over accuracy. Platforms have made efforts—fact-checking labels, reduced amplification of flagged content—but these solutions come with their own problems. Who decides what's misinformation? What about contested claims where experts disagree? The solutions that seem most promising involve not just flagging falsehoods but building what researchers call 'prebunking'—teaching people to recognize manipulation techniques before they encounter them. Media literacy education, which focuses on questioning sources and understanding how information is constructed, may be more effective than playing whack-a-mole with individual false claims.",

      "transcript": "Traditional journalism faces an existential challenge. The business model that sustained serious reporting for a century—advertising revenue subsidizing news production—has collapsed as digital platforms captured the advertising market. Newsrooms have shrunk dramatically; local news has been devastated. Yet I'm cautiously optimistic. New models are emerging. Subscription-based digital journalism has proven viable for some outlets—though typically those with national or global reach. Nonprofit journalism is expanding, funded by foundations and reader donations. Collaborative models, where news organizations share resources for investigations they couldn't afford alone, are producing impactful work. What concerns me more than the business model is the erosion of shared facts. When we can't agree on basic reality—when 'fake news' becomes a weapon to dismiss inconvenient truths—democracy itself is at risk. The financial sustainability of journalism matters because accountability journalism matters. Who will investigate corruption if no one can afford to?",
