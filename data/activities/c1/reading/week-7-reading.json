    "title": "The Platform Economy",
    "author": "Adapted from technology and economics sources",
    "paragraphs": [
      "The platform economy has transformed how we work, shop, and connect. Companies like Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb don't create products; they orchestrate ecosystems. Their value lies not in assets but in network effects: each additional user makes the platform more valuable to all others. A marketplace with more sellers attracts more buyers; more buyers attract more sellers. This dynamic creates winner-take-all markets where a few dominant platforms capture most of the value.",
      "For workers, platformization has proven double-edged. Gig economy platforms offer flexibility: drivers set their own hours; freelancers choose their clients. But this flexibility often comes with precarity. Platform workers typically lack benefits, job security, and collective bargaining power. The algorithmic management that coordinates their work can be opaque and unaccountable—a driver deactivated by an algorithm has no manager to appeal to. The question of whether platform workers are employees or independent contractors remains contentious, with significant implications for labor rights and social safety nets.",
      "The data dimension adds another layer of complexity. Platforms don't just facilitate transactions; they capture data from every interaction. This data generates insights that can be monetized—through targeted advertising, through predictive analytics, through training AI systems. Critics argue that this represents a new form of extraction: users create value through their data, but platforms capture most of the benefit. The asymmetry is structural: platforms know everything about users; users know little about platforms.",
      "Regulatory responses are emerging. The European Union's Digital Markets Act designates large platforms as 'gatekeepers' subject to enhanced obligations. Antitrust authorities increasingly scrutinize platform acquisitions that might eliminate potential competitors. Yet regulation struggles to keep pace with technological change, and the global nature of digital markets complicates national enforcement. The platform economy raises fundamental questions about market power, labor relations, and data rights that existing frameworks may not adequately address."
