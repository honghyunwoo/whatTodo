    "passage": "Social media has transformed how we communicate, but is it all positive? One advantage of social media is that it allows us to connect with friends and family around the world. It also provides access to news and information instantly. However, there are significant disadvantages. A major concern is privacy. Many people share personal information without realizing the risks. Additionally, social media can be addictive. Studies show that excessive use may lead to anxiety and depression, especially among teenagers. Cyberbullying is another serious issue. Although platforms have tried to address this, it remains a problem. On the other hand, social media can be used positively for education and awareness campaigns. In my opinion, the key is moderation. We should enjoy the benefits of social media while being aware of its potential dangers.",

True. I've been thinking about doing a digital detox. That's a good idea. Although it might be difficult at first, you'd probably feel better. I think so too. What about you? How do you manage your screen time? I try to set limits. I don't use my phone during meals, and I turn it off an hour before bed. That sounds healthy. Maybe I should try that.",
