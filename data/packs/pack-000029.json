For example, while making direct eye contact is valued in Western cultures as a sign of confidence, in some Asian cultures it can be seen as disrespectful, especially with elders. Similarly, attitudes toward time vary. Americans and Germans tend to be very punctual, whereas in some Mediterranean and Latin cultures, being slightly late is more accepted. Communication styles also differ. People from individualistic cultures, like the US, tend to be more direct, while those from collectivist cultures often communicate more indirectly to maintain harmony. It is important to remember that these are generalizations, and individuals within any culture can vary greatly. The key is to approach other cultures with an open mind and willingness to learn.",

Well, unlike in my country, people in Korea tend to be very conscious of age. I had to learn to speak differently to older people. That must have been challenging. It was at first. Also, I noticed that compared to Western cultures, personal space is different here. People stand closer together. Did you find it uncomfortable? A bit at first, but I got used to it. Now I understand it's just a cultural difference, not something wrong. That's a good attitude. What do you appreciate most about Korean culture? I think the respect for elders is beautiful. It is customary to show respect in many small ways. Also, I love the food culture - eating together is so important here.",
