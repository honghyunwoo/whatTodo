In their opinion, uniforms create equality among students because everyone wears the same clothes. They also believe that uniforms help students focus on studying instead of fashion. However, others disagree. They argue that uniforms limit students' freedom of expression. From their point of view, students should be able to choose their own clothes. Personally, I think both sides have good points. Uniforms can be helpful, but I believe students should also have some freedom to express themselves. What's your opinion on this topic?",
