The first store had nice jackets, but they were too expensive. In the second store, I found a blue jacket that I really liked. I asked the sales assistant if they had it in a medium size. Unfortunately, it was sold out. Finally, in the third store, I found the perfect jacket. It was warm enough for winter and the price was reasonable. It was also 20% off! I tried it on in the fitting room, and it fit perfectly. I paid by credit card and kept the receipt.",
