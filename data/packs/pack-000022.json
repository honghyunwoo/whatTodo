If we reduced food waste, there would be enough food for everyone. Some people might say this isn't realistic. They would argue that if it were easy, someone would have done it already. However, I believe that if we don't try, nothing will change. Unless we take action, problems like hunger will continue. If everyone contributed a little, we could make a big difference.",
