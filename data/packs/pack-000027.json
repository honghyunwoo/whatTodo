As a result of this pollution, marine life is suffering greatly. Sea turtles, fish, and seabirds often mistake plastic for food. Consequently, many animals die from eating plastic waste. The problem is getting worse because plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose. However, there are solutions. First, we need to reduce our use of single-use plastics. Instead of plastic bags, we should use reusable ones. Second, recycling must become a priority. Many countries have already banned plastic bags and straws. I strongly believe that if everyone makes small changes, we can make a big difference. It is essential that we act now before it's too late.",

Well, I think we need to invest more in renewable energy. If we used solar and wind power instead of fossil fuels, we could significantly reduce emissions. I agree. Also, individuals should try to reduce their carbon footprint. Simple things like using public transportation or eating less meat can help. Absolutely.
