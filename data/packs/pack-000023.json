The beans are then shipped to different countries, where they are roasted by coffee companies. The roasting process is carefully controlled to bring out the best flavors. After roasting, the beans are ground and packaged. Finally, the coffee is sold in stores and enjoyed by millions of people every day. From farm to cup, coffee is touched by many hands.",
